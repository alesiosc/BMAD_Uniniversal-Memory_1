# Project Brief: Universal Memory

## Executive Summary
The Universal Memory project is a local-first, privacy-focused application designed to act as a universal, persistent memory layer for a user's interactions with various AI models and tools. It aims to solve the problem of fragmented conversations and lost context that occurs when switching between different AI assistants (web, IDE, or CLI). By automatically capturing and intelligently retrieving information from past interactions, the system will provide seamless conversational continuity, enhance the capabilities of free AI models, and empower users with a unified "external brain" for all their AI-driven tasks.

## Problem Statement
In the current AI landscape, users frequently interact with multiple, specialized AI models across various platforms, including web browsers, IDEs, and CLIs. This leads to a significant and frustrating problem:

* **Fragmented Memory:** Each AI service maintains its own separate, siloed conversation history. There is no unified memory, forcing users to manually re-establish context whenever they switch tools or start a new session.
* **Loss of Context:** When a user switches from one AI to another (e.g., after hitting a rate limit on a free model), the entire conversational thread and all learned information are lost. This breaks the flow of work and dramatically reduces the AI's effectiveness.
* **Inefficient Workflows:** Users are burdened with manually copying and pasting conversations to preserve context, a process that is tedious, error-prone, and often forgotten, leading to wasted time and repetitive effort.
* **Untapped Potential:** Without a persistent, universal memory, the long-term potential for an AI to truly learn from a user's entire history of interactions and provide deeply personalized, accurate, and consistent assistance is never realized.

## Proposed Solution
We propose the creation of Universal Memory, a free, local-first desktop application that functions as a comprehensive, persistent "external brain" for all of the user's AI interactions.

* **Core Approach:** The system will be built as a desktop application that runs in the background. It will utilize a multi-pronged, real-time capture system to automatically record conversations from virtually any AI tool the user interacts with. This data will be processed and stored locally in a hybrid database system. When the user engages with an AI, the application will intelligently retrieve relevant context from this unified memory and provide it to enrich the prompt, ensuring seamless conversational continuity.
* **Key Differentiators:** True Universality, Automated & Seamless Integration, Local-First and Free.

## Target Users
**Primary User Segment: The AI Power User**
A technically proficient individual, such as a developer, researcher, or AI enthusiast, who frequently interacts with a variety of free AI models across web browsers, IDEs, and CLIs. Their primary need is a frictionless way to maintain conversational context and memory across all their disparate AI tools.

## Goals & Success Metrics
* **Project Objectives:** Deliver Core Functionality, Ensure User Sovereignty, Establish a Foundation.
* **User Success Metrics:** Reduced Workflow Friction, Improved Conversational Continuity, Enhanced AI Output Quality.
* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Capture Reliability >95%, Retrieval Relevance >80%, Performance < 500ms.

## MVP Scope
* **Core Features (Must-Have):** Browser Extension Capture, Semantic Memory Core, Local-First Storage, Essential Dashboard Functionality, Basic AI Model Comparison.
* **Out of Scope for MVP:** Procedural Memory, Advanced capture methods (IDE/CLI), Advanced dashboard features, Dynamic model comparison.
