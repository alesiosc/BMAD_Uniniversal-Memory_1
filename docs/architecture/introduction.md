# Introduction
This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for Universal Memory, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

### Starter Template or Existing Project
Based on the PRD, this is a greenfield project. The PRD does not mention a specific starter template. Given the technology stack (Tauri, React, Python), a pre-existing fullstack template is unlikely to fit perfectly. Therefore, we will be setting up the project from scratch, combining the individual tooling for each part of the stack within a monorepo.

**Decision:** N/A - Greenfield project building from scratch.
