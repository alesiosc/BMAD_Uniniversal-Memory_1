# Goals and Background Context

### Goals
* Deliver Core Functionality: Launch a functional MVP that automatically captures, stores, and retrieves AI conversations from a web browser.
* Ensure User Sovereignty: Guarantee that 100% of user interaction data is stored and processed locally.
* Establish a Foundation: Create a stable, foundational platform for future expansion.

### Background Context
The core problem we're solving is the fragmented and temporary nature of user interactions with various AI models across different platforms. This forces users to constantly re-establish context, leading to inefficient workflows and a loss of valuable information. The proposed solution, Universal Memory, is a local-first desktop application that acts as a persistent "external brain" by automatically capturing these interactions. This allows it to provide unified context and history, enhancing the utility of any AI the user interacts with.
