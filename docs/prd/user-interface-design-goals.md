# User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The user experience should be efficient, data-dense, and professional, designed for a technical "AI Power User". The interface must prioritize speed and clarity, allowing users to quickly search, retrieve, and manage their memories without friction. It should feel like a powerful, reliable utility that runs quietly in the background and provides immediate value when accessed.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
* **Passive Capture:** The browser extension will capture interactions automatically with zero user input required.
* **Active Retrieval:** The desktop dashboard will be the primary interface for searching, viewing, and managing memories.
* **Command Palette Style Search:** The search functionality should be fast and keyboard-driven, similar to tools like Alfred, Raycast, or the VS Code command palette.

### Core Screens and Views
* **Main Dashboard:** A central view displaying a reverse-chronological feed of the most recently captured memories.
* **Search View:** The primary interface for performing semantic searches across the entire memory database.
* **Memory Detail View:** A view to inspect a single captured conversation in its entirety.
* **Settings:** A screen for configuring the application, managing capture sources, and other preferences.

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
The proposed standard is WCAG AA to ensure the application is usable by a wide range of individuals.

### Branding
A minimalist, clean, dark-themed aesthetic is suggested, suitable for a developer-focused tool that prioritizes text clarity and information density.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
The core application is a cross-platform desktop app for Windows, macOS, and Linux. The UI should be built with responsive principles to function well on various screen sizes and resolutions.
