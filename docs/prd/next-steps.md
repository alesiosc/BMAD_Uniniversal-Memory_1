# Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt
"Please create the detailed **UI/UX Specification** for the Universal Memory project. Use this PRD as your guide, paying close attention to the 'User Interface Design Goals' and the target 'AI Power User' persona. Your primary focus should be on mapping out the detailed user flows for the core features defined in the epics and creating the initial component library structure."

### Architect Prompt
"Please create the **Fullstack Architecture Document** for the Universal Memory project. Use this PRD as your definitive guide, ensuring all 'Technical Assumptions' are treated as hard constraints. The architecture must support the local-first, client-server model using Tauri and Python, and accommodate the full testing pyramid. Please provide a detailed plan for the monorepo structure."
