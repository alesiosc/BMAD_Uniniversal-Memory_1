Step 2: ADD YOUR PROJECT FILES
==============================
Using your computer's file explorer, find the project folder where you have been saving all 68 of our files.

Copy all the contents from that folder (the docs, apps, packages folders, the package.json file, etc.).

Paste all of those files and folders directly into the new universal-memory folder that VS Code just created and opened.

Part 2: COMITTING YOUR WORK
===========================
Now that your files are in the correct, Git-connected folder, you can commit them to GitHub.

Step 1: Open the Source Control Panel

On the far left side of your VS Code window, click on the icon that looks like three dots connected by lines (a branching symbol). This is the Source Control panel.

Step 2: Stage Your Changes

You will see a long list of all the new files you just pasted, under a "Changes" section.

Hover your mouse over the "Changes" title, and a + (plus) icon will appear. Click this + icon to "stage" all the files. This prepares all of them for the commit.

Step 3: Write the Commit Message

At the very top of the Source Control panel, you will see a text box for the commit message.

Click in this box and type a clear message describing this commit. A good message would be:
feat: Initial commit of all planning and source files for MVP

Step 4: Commit and Push

Click the "Commit" button (it might be a checkmark icon).

After the commit is complete, the button will change to "Sync Changes". Click this button.

Part 1: INITIAL SETUP (One-Time Only)
=====================================
First, we need to connect your local project folder to the remote GitHub repository. The cleanest way to do this is by "cloning" the empty repository from GitHub first.

Step 1: Clone the Repository from GitHub

Open VS Code. If your universal-memory project is already open, close it for now using File > Close Folder.

Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac).

In the Command Palette, type Git: Clone and press Enter.

A box will appear at the top. Paste the repository URL you provided:
https://github.com/alesiosc/universal-memory.git

Press Enter. VS Code will then ask you where to save the project on your computer. Choose a location (e.g., your Desktop or a projects folder).

Once it's finished cloning, VS Code will ask if you want to open the cloned repository. Click "Open".
