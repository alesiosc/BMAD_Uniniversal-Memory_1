# Universal Memory Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context
#### Goals
* Deliver Core Functionality: Launch a functional MVP that automatically captures, stores, and retrieves AI conversations from a web browser.
* Ensure User Sovereignty: Guarantee that 100% of user interaction data is stored and processed locally.
* Establish a Foundation: Create a stable, foundational platform for future expansion.

## Requirements
#### Functional Requirements
* **FR1**: Provide a browser extension for automatic AI interaction capture.
* **FR2**: Store conversations locally and generate vector embeddings.
* **FR3**: Provide a desktop dashboard to view, search, import, and delete memories.
* **FR4**: Provide a basic, static AI model comparison feature.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
* **NFR1**: All data must be stored exclusively on the user's local machine.
* **NFR2**: Retrieval time must be less than 500 milliseconds.
* **NFR3**: Must be built with free and open-source software.
* **NFR4**: Core app must be cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).
* **NFR5**: Capture reliability must be over 95%.

## Technical Assumptions
* **Repository Structure:** Monorepo.
* **Service Architecture:** Local client-server model (Tauri/React client, Python server).
* **Testing Requirements:** Full Testing Pyramid (Unit, Integration, E2E).
* **Core Technologies:** Tauri, React, Python, SQLite, ChromaDB.

## Epic List
* **Epic 1: Foundation & Core Capture**
* **Epic 2: Memory Retrieval & Interaction**
* **Epic 3: Refinement & Usability**
